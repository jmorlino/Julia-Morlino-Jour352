        <figcaption>A Pulitzer Prize, Grammy, Emmy, Tony Award-winning composer, lyricist and actor, Lin-Manuel Miranda is the creator and original star of Broadway’s <i>Hamilton</i>.</figcaption>
      </div>

    <p>From its opening night in 2015, <i>Hamilton: An American Musical</i> has continued to educate, inspire and entertain audiences across the globe.  Creator Lin-Manuel Miranda composed a score blending hip-hop, jazz, R&B, and Broadway to teach people about the past through the music that is so prominent today. The story of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton as told through musical forums outside the norm is what made this musical a central figure in American culture.</p>

    <p>The introduction of popular genres into the theatre world has blurred the lines between modern music and showtunes. <i>Hamilton</i> has become a common entertainment source for more than just theatre lovers. Its fresh, innovative and catchy lyrics and accessible cast recordings on streaming services has expanded the target audience and united Americans even more. The contemporary soundtrack used to fuse American history with current politics has captured the interest of people of different ages, races and social classes, and people who love musicals and people who hate them.</p>
    <p>The <i>Hamilton</i> soundtrack was the <a href="https://standard.asl.org/10311/culture/impact-of-musicals-on-culture/"target="_blank">first Broadway recording</a> to reach the top 100 on the Billboard rap charts in 2015 and peaked as <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/9400765/hamilton-billboard-200-chart-history-cast-album"target="_blank">number 3 on Billboard 200</a> in 2016. Today, it is 6th place on the list of cast albums with the longest runs on the Billboard 200 chart— and the number continues to increase.</p>

<p class="chapter-headline"><i>Hamilton</i> From Home</p>

    <p>In addition to influencing the theatre world with popular genres like rap, <i>Hamilton</i> has also made an impact on popular culture. Its onstage production featuring the original cast has made its way to the big screen, streaming on Disney Plus since July 3.</p>

  <p><br>Releasing the show at this time is compelling to the nation considering the consequences of COVID-19. The global pandemic has enforced months of quarantine and the shut down of many highly populated spaces including Broadway theatres. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/theater/when-broadway-reopening-coronavirus.html"target="_blank">On June 29</a>, Broadway announced that it will be closed for the remainder of the year and performances will resume on a rolling basis in early 2021. With that said, there is no confirmed date for the reopening of <i>Hamilton</i>.</p>
  <p>Although under unprecedented consequences, the release of <i>Hamilton’s</i> onstage production came at the right time. Fans now have the opportunity to stream Broadway from home despite the shut down.</p>

<a id="Ahead"></a>
<p class="chapter-headline">Ahead Of Its Time</p>
<p>While advocating for the importance of American history, <i>Hamilton</i> makes impressive strides in terms of racial representation.<br>

<blockquote>"This is the story of America then, using America now"</blockquote>

<p>A majority of the cast are people of color despite the known race of the historical figures featured in the show. The casting is meant to retell the life of Alexander Hamilton with people who <a href="https://studybreaks.com/culture/hamilton-musical/"target="_blank">reflect what Americans look like today</a>. As Miranda describes, <i>Hamilton</i> is "the story of America then, using America now." Even though casting the founding fathers as people of color may not be historically accurate, it is a culturally accurate portrayal of the 21st century <a href="https://www.ksat.com/features/2020/07/03/hamilton-and-race-a-very-powerful-statement-without-having-to-be-a-statement/"target="_blank">built by immigrants</a>. Lin has created an inclusive version of history allowing every American, including minorities, to see his or herself reflected in story of the founding fathers. <i>Hamilton</i> brings light to the place minorities have
  <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/how-hamilton-is-revolutionizing-american-musical-theatre"target="_blank">always deserved in America</a>.<br>

  <p>One of the many lessons <i>Hamilton</i> teaches is to take a stand. It highlights the importance of educating oneself and finding a voice to make a positive change. Americans cannot afford to <a href="https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2020/7/3/21304581/letter-what-hamilton-can-teach-us-about-politics-today"target="_blank">adopt Aaron Burr’s philosophy of cowardness</a> as portrayed in the show — it’s time to rise up.</p>

        <figcaption>Black Lives Matter protestors hold up posters quoting lyrics from <i>Hamilton.</i></figcaption>
      </div>

  <p>The lessons taught in <i>Hamilton</i> are especially relevant today in terms of the Black Lives Matter movement. The production modernizes history and breaks racial boundaries onstage, keeping race at the forefront. Today, racial representation remains just as prominent as Miranda made it onstage. In fact, protestors are writing quotes from <i>Hamilton</i> on posters. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lin-manuel-miranda-interview-hamilton-disney-streaming-11592599765?tesla=y"target="_blank">“There’s nothing new about what’s happening,”</a> says Miranda about the Black Lives Matter protests. “It’s been interesting to see the different things that pop up, because I was trying to tell this specific story, but I was grabbing from the America I know. So it all hits in different ways, based on where America is.”</p>

<a id="Benchmark"></a>
  <p class="chapter-headline">A Musical Benchmark</p>

  <p><i>Hamilton</i> is added to the list of Broadway musicals that have paved the musical culture. Its unique musicality and contemporary reflection of American history is one of a kind and something that will never go ignored. Teachers will use the production to educate, monumental lyrics will continue to be displayed, and popular music genres will remain in the Broadway industry.</p>
  <p> If you have read this far you are most likely dying to see the production live if you haven't already. The following map shows the U.S. tour dates and locations (that haven't been postponed due to COVID-19) of the <i>Hamilton</i> North America Tour. If the onstage production on Disney Plus isn't enough, see if the production is coming to a city near you!</p>
